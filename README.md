# Overview


This is a website designed to help me practice HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also took time to build this concept website by creating wireframes and a style guide. Both are accessible from the website itself. To view it go to the right side menu and click on the github-pages tab. Click `View Deployment` on the most recent build.

The `website` branch contains the live website hosted with GitHub pages.
