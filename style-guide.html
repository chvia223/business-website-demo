                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Roboto Slab: Used for headlines.

                    <li>
                        Inter: Used for the primary font.

                <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
                <p>
                    Have you ever watched someone playing the guitar and thought to yourself, 
                    “Wow, I wish I could do something cool like that.”? What if I told you 
                    you could? I’ve been playing and practicing guitar for over 10 years now 
                    and have started to feel like it’s time to share what I’ve learned. I 
                    can help you learn the basics and give you enough structure in your 
                    practice that you’ll propel your learning fast. You might be able to 
                    learn everything on your own, but with me, you won’t have to waste 
                    your time searching for the next step. Check out my website to learn more.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
                <p>
                    I’m Christian and I love playing the guitar. It’s my passion and it’s 
                    something that I want to share. I remember when I first started learning. 
                    I didn’t have the money to pay for formal lessons and I had no clue what 
                    I needed to learn to get better or where to find it. My website would be 
                    a place for me to share what I have learned in an organized way so 
                    newcomers and beginners to guitar can spend less time wandering and more 
                    time practicing. I would provide material and techniques that will help 
                    people become better guitar players. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Audience Statement</h2>
                <p>
                    I wish to help all those who are interested in learning the guitar, but 
                    have never felt like they had the resources or the know how to learn on 
                    their own. I want to keep everything free in order to help as many 
                    people as possible. You never know who could become the next Eric 
                    Clapton or Joe Bonamassa after all. I expect many of the visitors to 
                    the website to be a younger audience between the ages of 13-18. With 
                    that in mind, I expect the majority of the devices accessing the site 
                    to be laptops or smart phones. Creating an accessible mobile user 
                    experience will be necessary.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Misson Statement</h2>
                <p>
                    I, Christian Viazzo, believe that each person with the desire to learn 
                    the guitar should have the experience of doing so with confidence and 
                    consistency. That is why I am providing a streamlined guide of the 
                    things that have helped me improve over the years. The goal in doing 
                    this is to make powerful and productive learning material that is as 
                    accessible to as many people as possible. The principles that I will 
                    teach, pulled from current popular music, will provide confidence and 
                    relevance to those who want to show off their new skills. Expect to 
                    stretch and grow as you explore the guitar.

                <h2>Persona and Scenario Ideas</h2>
                <p>
                    Name: Luke
                    <br>
                    Age: 16
                    <br>
                    Motivation: To learn how to write better music.
                    <br>
                    Goal: To get a better understanding of how music is structured and how
                    to use that in my guitar practicing.
                    <br>
                    Technological Proficiency: Capable
                    <br><br>
                    Background: As a guitar player, I want to be able to understand how the
                    music I play works because I feel like it will help me write my own
                    music better.
                    <br><br>
                    Scenario: Luke gets on the website because he doesn’t quite understand 
                    the concept of music being used in a song he’s learning, but he knows 
                    the term for the concept being used. Our website should have a tab for 
                    common concepts covered by the guides and tutorials. When Luke clicks 
                    on the tab it opens to a list. He sees the term he’s looking for and 
                    it opens up a list of guides and tutorials where that concept is 
                    covered. At this point Luke has options to choose from. From these 
                    options he’ll be able to see how the same concept is used in different 
                    scenarios.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Name: Michela
                    <br>
                    Age: 19
                    <br>
                    Motivation: To learn how to play the guitar and write songs better.
                    <br>
                    Goal: To be able to learn quickly and clearly and not waste time.
                    <br>
                    Technological Proficiency: Capable
                    <br><br>
                    Background: As a student, I don’t have a lot of time to look around 
                    for disconnected parts or guides to learn how to play the guitar, 
                    so I would really appreciate a place where I could find everything 
                    in one place.
                    <br><br>
                    Scenario: Michela gets on the website because she finally has some 
                    free time after studying all day. She only has 30 minutes to an hour 
                    so she needs to get going quickly. She has been on the website before 
                    and wants to start where she left off last time she visited. There 
                    should be a tab to continue a guide that was previously opened to get 
                    to it quickly otherwise in the list of guides there should be check 
                    marks next to guides that have been completed. For technicalities, 
                    this can either be tracked by a user account registered with the 
                    website or through cookies. Upon clicking on this, Michela should be 
                    taken directly to the guide she was working on before as fast as she 
                    can. In case she needs a refresher on previously learned material, 
                    there should be a list in the margin to show previously completed and 
                    currently working on guides that Michela would be able to easily 
                    click on and access. It may be good to include a save or bookmark 
                    function somewhere obvious to better categorize where Michela leaves 
                    off when she needs to leave.
